JavaScript game made with no frameworks. This game was made following this tutorial "". There were many issues with the tutorial which i have tried to solve.
For example, movement cancelled when pressing 2 keys at the same time, forcing you to keyup to reset movement. I solved this  by adding diagonal movement.
Check main.js for more

I also added more features like a commands bar which allows you to change various aspects of the game via in-game such as player speed, render collisions
(true/false) and more.
